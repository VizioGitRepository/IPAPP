EMPLOYEE LIST

-EmployeeName+Numbers editor->edit btn->3 options -->Edit existing (enter table id+name+number)-->submit button -->route.js -->mongoose-->db
						  -->add new employee                          -->submit button -->route.js-->mongoose-->db
						  -->Delete employee (just enter Table ID)     -->sumbit button -->routing.js-->mongoose-->db
OR

-EmployeeNames+numbers-->edit on click-->update button-->mongoose-->db
                      -->delete on bin icon-->alert-->mongoose-->db
-I have an array of objects [{}...{}...{}]
-step one, splice array to create seperate objects
-step 2 merge objects into one objects
-step 3 use for Post Request 
-alert=== "are you sure you want to delete" + employee name? +"from this table?"


AGENCY TRACKER

Parsing raw info
-has to be in json
-assign id to a name and add all keys+values on day after day?
-create an id for each value, have an edit button, save button and delete button?** best idea so far because even
it doesnt allow for doubles to be made when a name has a slight misspelling.
-best way to do this for now is to do the employeenames+numbers abd see how the basics are.

-edit row icon
-delete row icon
-save icon.


-Save btn so they can be saved for further updating throughout the week 
-every week creates a new collection
-make a program that exports a collection to an excel file
-make a program that can take that excel file and after confirmation can send it via email

							Other

-Agency tracker -> database -> Supervisor "check Page"-> "send as email" button

-Agency tracker REST:
	-Make proper schema, export 
	-figure out how to work mongoDB
-Tube Search REST
	-Will be simplest to start with along the employee names and numbers
	-will go by item# or pasta type+grams
